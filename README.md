Description:
- An Arduino library for the [Grove - I2C Color Sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-i2c-color-sensor-p-854.html?cPath=25_27)
- Supports the use of pre-measured or pre-calibrated colors for specific projects.
- Supports multiple color sensors used in parallel
- An example is provided for using two sensors with a 74HC4052 MUX

####[minimalDuino_107](https://github.com/adrcotfas/Arduino/tree/master/minimalDuino_107)

Description:
- PBC design for an Arduino Uno compatible board
- Single-sided, home-etchable with wide traces and 7 top jumper wires
- Compatible with shields designed to fit on top
- Different power connector options, 5V or 3.3V power regulation and options for crystal and caps or a resonator
- Power suply and debugging with FTDI breakout
- Better shield-friendliness by placing LEDs and the reset switch(side switch or top switch) at the edges of the board
